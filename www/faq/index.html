<h1>Frequently (un)Asked Questions(FAQ)</h1>

<p>Actually none of these questions are frequently asked, I am just making these up.</p>

<h2>What do you with my letter? Do you sell my address? Do you read my letters?</h2>

<p>Indeed it is possible for me to read your letters. An evil network operator
between you on my server in London could do the same since site does not use <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL</a>. Though I
do not read your letters and
you will just have to trust me that this is the case. URLs (which only you
should know) to your generated
PDF letter are deleted daily.</p>

<h2>I don't trust you! I want to run this tool on my own computer. Where is
the source code I can download?</h2>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/kaihendry/letterly"> source
code</a>. It relies on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xetex">xetex</a>.</p>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>The author of this simple script is <a href="http://iki.fi/hendry">Kai
Hendry</a>. Be nice.</p>

<h2>How do I save my letter?</h2>
